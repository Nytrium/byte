# byte

Byte is an Open-Source Discord bot made in Python, meant to (hopefully) be able to replace MEE6 and other large/popular moderation bots someday.

## Note:
Once (Hikari)[https://www.hikari-py.dev/] comes out with it's first full official release, I will be moving the bot to that wrapper as soon as possible.
