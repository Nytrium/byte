# Byte

Byte is an Open-Source Discord bot made in Python, meant to replace MEE6 and other popular moderation bots.

## Note:
Once [Hikari](https://www.hikari-py.dev/) get fully released, I will be moving the bot to that wrapper as soon as possible.

> Once I get off my lazy ass and study JavaScript, I will be moving the bot to Discord.js as soon as possible.
